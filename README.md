Repository for the Volta Project - helping find families of homeless people.

# Volta - an open-source app

 The Volta is a project for helping finding missing people based on the higher probability of them being homeless people scattered on cities. It's an open source iniciative to be deployed uniquely on each country since the main database will help to center queries, thus maximizing chance of encountering.

## What it is about?

It's about care. Social agents can centralize their care registries, following homeless people behavior and habits, improving their condition and dignity. With enough information, the application can search Missing people API's and Databases querying for matches. Once a match is found the social agent can intervene to promote the encouter between family and the missing homeless person.

We want, in the long term, to develop a centrilzed Missing People Database, joined with the homeless people database. 

### Installing

## Built With

* [React](https://reactjs.org/) - Framework
* [Reactstrap](https://reactstrap.github.io/) - Framework standard components and stylling
* [React-leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org/) - React components for Leaflet maps
* [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) - an open-source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps
* [Open-streetMaps] (https://www.openstreetmap.org/) - Open Street Maps

## Issues

* Getting Location: the method from Navigator object is IP based, so the calling getCurrentPosition returns positions with great error range.
